# Discord-Peterbot

This a Discord Bot made with Python and started as a smaller porject to get to know the Discord API and learn Python a bit better.
It is developed and hosted on Repl.it and this just a port over into a Github Repo in order to streamline my projects onto one account.
This project is low priority and will only get updated once in a while, when I feel like.

All comments/strings/containers are in german.
